            <p>On August 23rd 1978, Kobe Bean Bryant was born into this world by a loving father and loving mother. His father, Joe Bryant was an NBA player at the time, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. </p>
            <p> In 1984, Joe Bryant took the family to Italy where he played in the Italian league. Kobe soon became an avid player of both soccer and basketball, and the rest is history.</p>

            <p> Kobe dominated his peers and would even play pickup ball with players twice his age. </p>

            <p> Kobe attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania and had no trouble showcasing what he was capable of. His burning desire to be one of the greats truly shined in the early stages of his career. Coupled with his talent, athleticism and
              unmatched work ethic, he was considered to be one of the best in the country.

              <p> Though he boasted good grades and high SAT scores, Bryant decided to go straight to the NBA from high school. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft, and was subsequently traded to the Los
                Angeles Lakers.</p>

            <p>During his first season with the Lakers, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. Initially, he played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see more playing time. He earned himself
              a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan-favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest. He also set a record 31 points in the Schick Rookie Game, erasing Jones' record of 25.</p>

          <p> In the following years, Kobe would take the league by <strong>storm</strong>.</p>

          <p>Kobe soon teamed up with superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships, and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-04. He also inked multi-year endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.</p>

          <p>Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark in NBA history, and led the league in scoring that year
            and the next.</p>

          <p>In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship. Shortly afterward, Bryant was part
            of the memorial service to honor friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.</p>

          <p>Bryant played on both the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams, winning consecutive gold medals with teammates Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, among several other top players.</p>

            <p>After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in April 2013, Bryant worked hard to return to the court before fracturing his knee just six games into the 2013-14 season. The veteran All-Star surpassed Michael Jordan for third all-time on the NBA
              scoring list in December 2014, but his season ended due to injury for the third straight year when he sustained a torn rotator cuff in January 2015. </p>
            <p> Although Bryant returned in time for the start of the 2015-16 NBA season, he personally struggled alongside his young Lakers teammates. In November 2015, he announced that he would retire at the end of the season. "This season is all I have
              left to give," he wrote on The Players' Tribune website. "My heart can take the pounding. My mind can handle the grind but my body knows it's time to say goodbye."</p>

            <p>The announcement drew a strong reaction, particularly from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "With 17 NBA All-Star selections, an NBA MVP, five NBA championships with the Lakers, two Olympic gold medals and a relentless work ethic, Kobe Bryant
              is one of the greatest players in the history of our game," Silver said in a statement. "Whether competing in the finals or hoisting jump shots after midnight in an empty gym, Kobe has an unconditional love for the game."</p>

            <p> On April 13, 2016, Bryant dazzled a sold-out crowd at the Staples Center and fans everywhere in the last game of his career, scoring 60 points and leading the Lakers to a win against the Utah Jazz. It was Bryant’s sixth 60-point game of his
              career</p>

            <p> After the game, Bryant spoke to the crowd. "I can't believe how fast 20 years went by . . .,” he said. "This is absolutely crazy . . . and to be standing at center court with you guys, my teammates behind me, appreciating the journey that
              we've been on — we've been through our ups, been through our downs. I think the most important part is we all stayed together throughout."</p>

            <p> An all-star lineup of Laker icons also payed tribute to Bryant including Shaquille O’Neal, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom and Magic Johnson.</p>

            <p> “We are here to celebrate greatness for 20 years,” Johnson said. “Excellence for 20 years. Kobe Bryant has never cheated the game, never cheated us as the fans. He has played through injury, he has played hurt. And we have five championship
              banners to show for it.</p>
